## GNN Explainabilty through Structure Subgraphs
This is a jupyter notebook implementation of our UCLA CS249 course project.
We used PyTorch framework and PyG, torch_geometric as the Graph library.

## Introduction
Given full graphs and GNNs, we want to know which subgraphs of the full graph make the GNN do the prediction it does.

## How to run
There is no environment requirement since we can just open/copy the jupyter notebooks in our repository and run them on Google Colab. The dataset is built-in in PyG library so it does not require additional setting.
Use a runtime with GPU if applicable to acclerate the model training part.
The model is small so it only takes a few minutes to train.
